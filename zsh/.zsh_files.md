# ZSH File Management Functions

A collection of ZSH functions for efficient file and directory management operations.

## Installation

### As Part of Dotfiles (Recommended)

1. Clone the dotfiles repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles

2. Run the setup script to create symlinks:
    
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh

The setup script will create the symlink:
- `~/.zsh_files` → `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zsh_files`

### Manual Installation

If you want to install just this file:

1. Copy .zsh_files to your dotfiles directory:
    
    cp .zsh_files ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zsh_files

2. Create the symlink:
    
    ln -sf ~/dotfiles/zsh/.zsh_files ~/.zsh_files

3. Add to your .zshrc:
    
    source ~/.zsh_files

## Dependencies

- zsh
- find (for deletebyattr)
- xargs (for batch operations)
- Oh My Zsh (recommended)

## Available Functions

### Directory Management

#### mkfolders
Creates multiple numbered folders in sequence.

    mkfolders <count> [prefix]
    
    Arguments:
    - count: Number of folders to create
    - prefix: Optional prefix for folder names (default: "folder")
    
    Example:
    mkfolders 5 chapter    # Creates: chapter_1, chapter_2, ..., chapter_5
    mkfolders 3           # Creates: folder_1, folder_2, folder_3

#### mkstructure
Creates predefined directory structures for different project types.

    mkstructure <template>
    
    Available templates:
    - project: src, tests, docs, assets
    - web: css, js, images, html
    - python: src, tests, data, notebooks
    - node: src, dist, public, components
    - docs: pages, images, assets, examples
    - api: routes, controllers, models, middleware
    
    Example:
    mkstructure python    # Creates Python project structure
    mkstructure web      # Creates web project structure

### File Operations

#### batchrename
Batch rename files matching a pattern.

    batchrename "<pattern>" "<from>" "<to>"
    
    Arguments:
    - pattern: File pattern to match (e.g., "*.txt")
    - from: Extension or pattern to replace
    - to: New extension or pattern
    
    Example:
    batchrename "*.txt" ".txt" ".md"    # Converts all .txt files to .md
    batchrename "file*" "file" "doc"    # Renames file1 to doc1, etc.

#### deletebyattr
Delete files by age and pattern.

    deletebyattr "<pattern>" "<days>"
    
    Arguments:
    - pattern: File pattern to match
    - days: Age of files (prefix with + for older than)
    
    Example:
    deletebyattr "*.log" "+7"    # Deletes .log files older than 7 days
    deletebyattr "*.tmp" "+1"    # Deletes .tmp files older than 1 day

#### batchop
Perform batch operations (move/copy/delete) on files.

    batchop <operation> "<pattern>" [destination]
    
    Operations:
    - move: Move files to destination
    - copy: Copy files to destination
    - delete: Remove matching files
    
    Arguments:
    - operation: move, copy, or delete
    - pattern: File pattern to match
    - destination: Target directory (required for move/copy)
    
    Examples:
    batchop move "*.pdf" ~/Documents    # Move all PDFs to Documents
    batchop copy "*.jpg" ~/Pictures     # Copy all JPGs to Pictures
    batchop delete "*.tmp"              # Delete all .tmp files

#### sortbytype
Sort files into directories based on their extensions.

    sortbytype [directory]
    
    Arguments:
    - directory: Optional target directory (default: current directory)
    
    Features:
    - Creates folders named after file extensions
    - Moves files into corresponding folders
    - Handles files without extensions ('noext' folder)
    - Moves problematic files to 'other' folder
    - Cleans up empty directories afterward
    - Case-insensitive extension matching
    
    Example:
    sortbytype ~/Downloads    # Organizes all files in Downloads
    sortbytype               # Organizes current directory
    
    Results in structure like:
    directory/
    ├── pdf/        # All PDF files
    ├── jpg/        # All JPG files
    ├── mp3/        # All MP3 files
    ├── noext/      # Files without extensions
    └── other/      # Files that couldn't be sorted

## Command Completion

The script includes ZSH completion for all file management commands. Use TAB to:
- See available commands
- Get command descriptions
- Auto-complete command names and paths

## Integration

These functions work well with:
- Standard Unix commands
- Other dotfiles components
- Shell scripts and automation
- Git operations (via .zsh_github)

## Safety Features

All destructive operations include:
- Confirmation prompts before execution
- Clear success/error messages
- Input validation
- Usage examples with --help
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Path existence checks

## Examples

Create a project structure and organize files:

    # Create a Python project
    mkstructure python
    
    # Create 5 chapter folders
    mkfolders 5 chapter
    
    # Move all PDFs to docs directory
    batchop move "*.pdf" docs
    
    # Convert all text files to markdown
    batchrename "*.txt" ".txt" ".md"
    
    # Clean up old log files
    deletebyattr "*.log" "+7"

## Updating

When using as part of dotfiles, update via:

    cd ~/dotfiles
    git pull
    ./setup.sh

For manual installations, simply replace the file and source it again:

    source ~/.zsh_files

## Contributing

Feel free to add new file operations or enhance existing ones. Ensure any new functions:
- Include appropriate safety checks
- Provide clear success/error messages
- Follow the existing naming convention
- Are documented with examples
- Include input validation
- Are added to the completion array
